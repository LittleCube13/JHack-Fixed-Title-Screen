# NLA's Flyover Editor problems:
	[23:38:20] <NLA> Well, I think that first, the 3rd flyover scene is
		clipping the text to size 80, for some reason.
	[23:38:42] <EBisumaru> we should just have it link to the text editor
	[23:38:50] <NLA> Well, that is to say, once you've changed the pointer
		to another location and started typing from there.
	[23:39:06] <NLA> Probably.
	[23:39:46] <NLA> Next, text that exceeds the size of the FE text box
		removes the "Update From Text Pointer" option, or whatever it is.
	[23:40:23] <NLA> A simple fix there would be a scrolling option, but
		its pretty bad that the Update Text button would correspond to
		the size of the text.
	[23:41:29] <NLA> I guess that whoever designed it first didn't quite
		anticipate people having larger text than the original, which is
		odd, since there seems to have always been the text pointer
		option there.
	[23:42:18] <NLA> Easy as that, I believe. Find out why its clipping it,
		and fix the text viewing window.
	[23:44:14] <NLA> I could find no other problems, but I'd like to suggest
		that BA's flyover tutorial and possibly whoever else's tutorial
		is linked to (as "My Simply/Quick Tutorial" or something of that
		nature) should just be files inside of PK Hack, which are simply
		executed from the option rather than require an internet connection
		to be active to quickly seize the data and put it in a miniature
		window. Just a suggestion though.
	[23:45:15] <NLA> Now, I must be off to sleep, I am very tired. I trust
		that either you, MrTenda, or AEB can look at the problem and attempt
		to fix it whenever you find the time. No rush, as always.

# AbstractRom: React to loadRom() returning false better/in more places
# Tile Editor: event flag based palette changes:
	Those colors (the first color entry in each 16-color subpalette) 
	contain additional data about the map palette as a whole. 
	The first transparent color in a 6-subpalette group contains the event flag 
	that controls whether that palette is used or not. The second transparent color 
	is a two-byte pointer to the map palette to be used if the event flag is set. 
	Somehow or other, when the Tile Editor imported the tileset data, it changed 
	this pointer from $8067 to $0067. That's why garbage data was being read for 
	the nighttime palette. Perhaps this is something to look into, Mr. Tenda? :B
	  - Mr. Accident in a forum post
	i.e., subpal 0's transparent color and subpal 1's transparent color are the
	event flag and pointer, respectively
# TextEditor: Routine Map
# [12:38:45] <JeffMan> oh and you should add the mother 2 font 
	and the debug menu font to jhack's font editor if you can
# Text Editor: Preview of next text block (optional) (in separate window?)
# Font table: http://pkhax.elpenguino.info/03F254.txt
# Other image import/export
# IPSDatabase extensions?
# Starting stat editor ( 1DAF1 = Value for Ness' starting stats )
# Battle Animation editor ( http://pkhack.fobby.net/misc/txt/psi_animation_doc.txt )
# Title screen editor
# Death screen editor
# Credits photo border graphics (Need to find palette)
	[16:53:42] <Chris_Davis|Away> Oh. BTW, you could add the 21EB4A to 21EC4F = Credits photo border graphics and arrangement (compressed)
	[16:54:36] <AnyoneEB> what palette does that use?
	[16:55:03] <Chris_Davis|Away> It's probably an unknown.
	[16:55:05] <Chris_Davis|Away> 21EB2A to 21EB49 = ***UNKNOWN (000020) - PALETTE***
	[16:55:45] <AnyoneEB> heh

  [21:46:30] <BlueAntoid> Something for eventual implementation into JHack:

  [21:46:30] <BlueAntoid> 1F900 - 1F901 = Number of bytes to read for above text
  [21:46:30] <BlueAntoid> 1F90F - 1F916 = Pointer to "Plain flavor"
  [21:46:30] <BlueAntoid> 1F92A - 1F931 = Pointer to "Mint flavor"
  [21:46:31] <BlueAntoid> 1F946 - 1F94C = Pointer to "Strawberry flavor"
