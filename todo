# [21:43:52] <JamesPicard_007> 2) It'd be nice to have the ability for Jhack 
	to automatically load the last ROM used. Just for convenience.

NEXT RELEASE

# Latest version of Jeffman's logos for ipslisting.xml when he finishes
# ??? --> [03:09:02] <EBisumaru> Dammit, JHack can't do the compression.
# [12:38:45] <JeffMan> oh and you should add the mother 2 font 
	and the debug menu font to jhack's font editor if you can
# DONE--TEST [21:42:57] <JamesPicard_007> 1) If JHack notifies you of a new download and 
	you choose not to download it it'd be nice if the prompt wouldn't return 
	unless a newer version comes out. I use JHack 4.7 and I keep getting the 
	prompt if I want to download 4.7.1 when I don't want to use it yet. 
  JP007: New version DL only ask once per new version
	(save pref with newest version denied?)
# Log to file. Files named for date/time JHack opened (new file for each
	JHack session), yyyymmddhhmmss.(out|err). Flush file output once per line? 
	(make sure it works with -c/--console)?
	Hidden pref to disable?
	# For errors: whenever an error is written (writing stops on error output for N secs)
		send log and error log (via HTTP if possible, look into file
		posting), have HTTP request be replied to with an ID number,
		error report window for ask for more info: description of
		circumstances, forum nick, other contact info, put in db
		(name log files by db row id?)
		Upon failure to send error log: (ignore|_fail_)?

LONG TERM

# Credits photo border graphics
	[16:53:42] <Chris_Davis|Away> Oh. BTW, you could add the 21EB4A to 21EC4F = Credits photo border graphics and arrangement (compressed)
	[16:54:36] <AnyoneEB> what palette does that use?
	[16:55:03] <Chris_Davis|Away> It's probably an unknown.
	[16:55:05] <Chris_Davis|Away> 21EB2A to 21EB49 = ***UNKNOWN (000020) - PALETTE***
	[16:55:45] <AnyoneEB> heh
# DONE?

# JHack: Convert settings and module list to XML. Create a format for simplier modules (up to enemy editor complexity) to be XML. Organize by appearence in editor (have <tab> & <column> tags) on <input> tags have offset and length attribs, maybe type, too (item, pointer (multiple types of pointers?), spt, etc)
