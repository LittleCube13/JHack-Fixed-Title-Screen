	[16:54:36] <AnyoneEB> what palette does that use?
	[16:55:03] <Chris_Davis|Away> It's probably an unknown.

# JHack: Convert settings and module list to XML. Create a format for simplier modules (up to enemy editor complexity) to be XML. Organize by appearence in editor (have <tab> & <column> tags) on <input> tags have offset and length attribs, maybe type, too (item, pointer (multiple types of pointers?), spt, etc)
