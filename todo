# Tile Editor: event flag based palette changes:
	Those colors (the first color entry in each 16-color subpalette) 
	contain additional data about the map palette as a whole. 
	The first transparent color in a 6-subpalette group contains the event flag 
	that controls whether that palette is used or not. The second transparent color 
	is a two-byte pointer to the map palette to be used if the event flag is set. 
	Somehow or other, when the Tile Editor imported the tileset data, it changed 
	this pointer from $8067 to $0067. That's why garbage data was being read for 
	the nighttime palette. Perhaps this is something to look into, Mr. Tenda? :B
	  - Mr. Accident in a forum post
	i.e., subpal 0's transparent color and subpal 1's transparent color are the
	event flag and pointer, respectively

	[16:54:36] <AnyoneEB> what palette does that use?
	[16:55:03] <Chris_Davis|Away> It's probably an unknown.
	[16:55:05] <Chris_Davis|Away> 21EB2A to 21EB49 = ***UNKNOWN (000020) - PALETTE***
