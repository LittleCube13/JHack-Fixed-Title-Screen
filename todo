NON-RELEASE

# Make (online) JHack TODO list

DONE? (CHANGES TO CONFIRM/DEBUG)

NEXT RELEASE

# Fixed by comp() bug fixes??? --> [03:09:02] <EBisumaru> Dammit,
	JHack can't do the compression.
	(Note to self: Don't worry about it. Can't find EBi, anyway.)
# Allow selection of compression for auto-update download (zip, 7z, bz2, rar)
# TextEditor: Routine Map
# Window positions editor
	[13:45:08] <GuyInSummers> AA AA BB BB CC CC DD DD. The window's topleft 
		corer is at AAAA x BBBB, and is CCCC wide and DDDD tall. 8 pixels to the unit.
	[13:45:44] <GuyInSummers> If you scroll down to the bottom of 
		http://pkhack.fobby.net/misc/stdarg.htm you'll see all the windows' 
		dimensions and where they're used, if you need reference
	[13:46:32] <GuyInSummers> Table starts at 3E450 but I forget if it starts 
		with a null entry or not... I don't think so
# [12:38:45] <JeffMan> oh and you should add the mother 2 font 
	and the debug menu font to jhack's font editor if you can
# Sprite Placement Editor API (GUI to be done by MrTenda), see 20040826 log for how to edit

LONG TERM

# Door placement, destinations, see 20040826 log for how to edit
# Gas Station image import/export
# IPSDatabase extensions?
# Starting stat editor ( 1DAF1 = Value for Ness' starting stats )
# Battle Animation editor ( http://pkhack.fobby.net/misc/txt/psi_animation_doc.txt )
# Title screen editor
# Death screen editor
# Credits photo border graphics
	[16:53:42] <Chris_Davis|Away> Oh. BTW, you could add the 21EB4A to 21EC4F = Credits photo border graphics and arrangement (compressed)
	[16:54:36] <AnyoneEB> what palette does that use?
	[16:55:03] <Chris_Davis|Away> It's probably an unknown.
	[16:55:05] <Chris_Davis|Away> 21EB2A to 21EB49 = ***UNKNOWN (000020) - PALETTE***
	[16:55:45] <AnyoneEB> heh
# DONE?
  [21:46:30] <BlueAntoid> Something for eventual implementation into JHack:
  [21:46:30] <BlueAntoid> 1F8F6 - 1F8FC = Pointer to "Which style of windows do you prefer?"
  [21:46:30] <BlueAntoid> 1F900 - 1F901 = Number of bytes to read for above text
  [21:46:30] <BlueAntoid> 1F90F - 1F916 = Pointer to "Plain flavor"
  [21:46:30] <BlueAntoid> 1F92A - 1F931 = Pointer to "Mint flavor"
  [21:46:31] <BlueAntoid> 1F946 - 1F94C = Pointer to "Strawberry flavor"
  [21:46:33] <BlueAntoid> 1F961 - 1F967 = Pointer to "Banana flavor"
  [21:46:35] <BlueAntoid> 1F97B - 1F982 = Pointer to "Peanut flavor"
  
NEVER
# JHack: Convert settings and module list to XML. Create a format for simplier modules (up to enemy editor complexity) to be XML. Organize by appearence in editor (have <tab> & <column> tags) on <input> tags have offset and length attribs, maybe type, too (item, pointer (multiple types of pointers?), spt, etc)
