NON-RELEASE

# Make (online) JHack TODO list

DONE? (CHANGES TO CONFIRM/DEBUG)

NEXT v0.0.0.x (bugfix) RELEASE
# Look into threading of error console GUI building (ERROR#65895)
# Look into use of JOptionPane.showOptionDialog() for abort/retry/fail.
# [01:40:42] <GuyInSummers> aeb: If you choose a text block in the 
	Text Editor, select Codes Only, and then move to another text block, 
	it informs you that you have to apply your changes or they'll be lost.

NEXT v0.0.x (minor) RELEASE

# AbstractRom: React to loadRom() returning false, at least in MainGUI
# TextEditor: Routine Map
# [12:38:45] <JeffMan> oh and you should add the mother 2 font 
	and the debug menu font to jhack's font editor if you can
# Text Editor: Preview of next text block (optional) (in separate window?)
# NeSs79: I have a suggestion for a future update if you think it worthy... 
	I think it would be cool if there was some kind of "clip board", if you will... 
	On the tile editing page... So you can copy minitiles on to it (more than one), 
	so you can paste them into a different tile set. Or the ability 
	to copy multiple mini tiles, but then it would be hard to paste them... 
	I think it would be very handy. Razz

LONG TERM

	[16:53:42] <Chris_Davis|Away> Oh. BTW, you could add the 21EB4A to 21EC4F = Credits photo border graphics and arrangement (compressed)
	[16:54:36] <AnyoneEB> what palette does that use?
	[16:55:03] <Chris_Davis|Away> It's probably an unknown.
	[16:55:05] <Chris_Davis|Away> 21EB2A to 21EB49 = ***UNKNOWN (000020) - PALETTE***
	[16:55:45] <AnyoneEB> heh
# DONE?
  [21:46:30] <BlueAntoid> Something for eventual implementation into JHack:

  [21:46:30] <BlueAntoid> 1F900 - 1F901 = Number of bytes to read for above text

# JHack: Convert settings and module list to XML. Create a format for simplier modules (up to enemy editor complexity) to be XML. Organize by appearence in editor (have <tab> & <column> tags) on <input> tags have offset and length attribs, maybe type, too (item, pointer (multiple types of pointers?), spt, etc)
