# This file defines how various ROM types are identified.
# A ROM type is a what game a ROM is (or at least was before
# being edited). The format is realitively simple, and making
# your own entries by example should be easy.
# ROM type names can contain any characters, including white
# space characters, other than #, and may not begin with a *,
# but it is suggested that no untypable characters are used
# and no characters outside of 7-bit ASCII are used.
# Whitespace at the start and end of each line is striped
# when reading. Tabs are used only for readability.
# Empty lines are ignored.
# 
# Format:
# First line = ROM type name
# Subsequent lines = an '*' then a hex offset, then a ':', and
#     then a series of bytes represented as two hex digits
#     separated by spaces. If a ROM has those bytes at that
#     offset, it is considered to have matched that check.
# Repeat the format for subsequent lines for as many checks as
# are required. If a rom matches all checks, it is considered 
# to be the ROM type name set on the first line.
# 
# Repeat that format for as many ROM types as are required.
