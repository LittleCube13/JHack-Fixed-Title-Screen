	if the .ips has been applied.
# IPS Database v0.5: Added API for support for non-ips files.
	Used by Font Editor, etc. Modified database to take advantage of this.

# (IntArr|Image)DrawingArea: bugfix: attempts to drag selections outside
	of allowed area now are ignored. (thanks FaulkFan420)
# (IntArr|Image)DrawingArea: width and height increased by one pixel so

	wants to expand the ROM with a remember checkbox.
