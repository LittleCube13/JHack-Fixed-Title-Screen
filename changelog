NEXT VERSION (after v0.5.0.1):
# IPSFile: BUGFIX: IPS creation no longer uses recursion, should fix obscure
	bug Red80 was getting.
# Error console: waits for 4 seconds no output before asking to send error.
# Error console: "error reporting error" messages can be copy and pasted from.
# Made compressed graphics editors not output errors for decompression errors,
	just dialogs and to the regular console.
# IPS Database: BUGFIX: Click apply with nothing selected
# AbstractRom: File not found errors no longer printed to error console,
	dialog still appears.

v0.5.0.1
# BUGFIX: IMPORTANT: AFFECTS MOST EDITORS. Number text fields work right. 
	(Would load incorrect values in v0.5)
# Text Editor: Improved error handling.
# Dialog window now informs user if a ROM file is not found.

v0.5:
# eb.TextEditor v0.6: Added support for multiple CC parsers. Used for
	coffee/tea/flyover and ending credits to be parsed according to 
	teacodelist.txt and creditcodelist.txt. Also added option for a 
	CC parser to not use compression, which is used for those two.
# eb.MiscTextEditor v0.5: Added Lumine hall text, max window width (250px)
# HexEditor: fixed bug where the goto switched regular and snes pointers
# Most recently loaded ROM is automatically loaded when JHack is opened.
	(suggested by JamesPicard_007) This can be disabled in the options menu. 
	(suggested by GuyInSummers)
# SpriteEditor: Hitting cancel on import/export no longer results in
	an error.
# Added log files. Two log files are created for each session with filenames
	in the format ~/.jhack/logs/yyyyMMddHHmmss.out.log (and .err.log).
# Automated error reporting (doesn't work with -c/--console argument)
# Rom class separated into AbstractRom and RomMem. Some of RomFileIO moved
	to AbstractRom as non-optimised implementations.
# Added some of JeffMan's graphics work to IPS Database
# New version notification only shown once. (suggested by JamesPicard_007)
# BUGFIX: A few comp() bugs fixed (thanks to Faolan for the bug report
	and Goplat for helping fix them). Attempt made to ensure that any other
	comp() bugs will not be fatal, unsure if it works.
# BUGFIX: Selecting "Close ROM" now hides module windows.
# Enemy Editor: Problems related to too high arguments are fixed and show a
	warning	message to inform the user what happened. (thanks EBPlayer1028)
# Minimised work done on ROM load (moved to module load) in order to do less
	unneeded tasks and speed up ROM loading.
# Added Map Editor (written by MrTenda)
# Created JLinkComboBox to make creation of links easier. Made lots of new
	links.
# Created NumericMaxLengthDocument for numbers-only text boxes (currently
	decimal numbers only). Changed many JTextFields to use this.

	# Gas station editor
